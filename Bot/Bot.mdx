Polymarket is a decentralized protocol currently in a **global rollout phase**.

While the technology is universal, the web interface is being released gradually across different jurisdictions to comply with local regulatory frameworks.

Currently, you might find that access is still limited in your region (similar to a "whitelist" system). If you try to access the platform and encounter a screen like the one below, it means your region does not have direct interface access yet.

</Frame>

## Unlocking Full Access

If you are in a region where the interface is not yet fully deployed (such as the United States), you can access the platform by routing your connection through a supported region.

This is done securely using a **VPN**. We recommend two options that allow you to **manually select your location** (essential for this process):

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="It's still restricted even with connection active">
    1. **Clear Cache:** Your browser might remember your previous location. Clear your cache/cookies or try opening an **Incognito/Private** window.
    2. **Check the Region:** If you selected "Canada" and it didn't work, you might be connected to a Toronto server (Ontario). Try switching to **Mexico**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internet is slow">
    Free VPNs can get congested due to high traffic. If speed is critical for your trading (sniping), consider upgrading to a paid plan like NordVPN for better latency.
