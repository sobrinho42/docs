Polymarket is a decentralized protocol currently in a **global rollout phase**.

While the technology is universal, the web interface is being released gradually across different jurisdictions to comply with local regulatory frameworks.

Currently, you might find that access is still limited in your region (similar to a "whitelist" system). If you try to access the platform and encounter a screen like the one below, it means your region does not have direct interface access yet.

## Unlocking Full Access

If you are in a region where the interface is not yet fully deployed (such as the United States), you can access the platform by routing your connection through a supported region.

This is done securely using a **VPN**. We recommend two options that allow you to **manually select your location** (essential for this process):

    Since most traders operate on the go, here is how to set up your connection on your phone.

    ### 1. Install the App
    Go to your app store and search for **"VPN Super Unlimited Proxy"** (blue key icon).
    
    * **iOS:** [Download on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vpn-super-unlimited-proxy/id1370293473)
    * **Android:** Search in Google Play Store.

    ### 2. Connect
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the App">
        Launch the app. You might see an ad (close it to proceed to the free version).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Location (Crucial)">
        Do **NOT** click the big "Connect" button immediately (it might connect you to a random location).
        
        Look for the **"Fastest Location"** or flag icon list. Tap it and manually select a supported country like **Canada**, **United Kingdom**, or **Germany**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect">
        Once the country is selected, toggle the connect switch. Wait for the "Connected" status.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Access Polymarket">
        Open your mobile browser (Safari/Chrome), go to Polymarket, and the interface should load without restrictions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Desktop (PC/Mac)">
    For desktop users, we recommend using a Browser Extension for quick access.

    ### Options
    * **Free:** **Urban VPN** (Browser Extension). It allows you to pick a country for free.
    * **Paid:** **NordVPN** (Desktop App).

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the Extension/App">
        Download your chosen VPN software.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select a Supported Region">
        Open the VPN interface.
        
        <Warning>
          **Important:** Ensure you select a location where Polymarket is active (e.g., **Canada**, **Mexico**, or **Japan**). Do not use a US server.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Refresh the Page">
        With the secure connection active, refresh your browser. The restriction warning should disappear.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="It's still restricted even with connection active">
    1. **Clear Cache:** Your browser might remember your previous location. Clear your cache/cookies or try opening an **Incognito/Private** window.
    2. **Change Server:** Disconnect and try a different country (e.g., if Canada fails, try United Kingdom).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internet is slow">
    Free VPNs can get congested due to high traffic. If speed is critical for your trading (sniping), consider upgrading to a paid plan like NordVPN for better latency.
