Polymarket is a decentralized protocol in a **global rollout phase**.

While the technology is universal, the web interface (the site you access) is being released gradually across different jurisdictions to comply with local regulatory frameworks.

Currently, you might find that access is still limited in your region (similar to a "whitelist" system). If you try to access the platform and encounter a screen like the one below, it means your region does not have direct interface access yet.

## Unlocking Full Access

If you are in a region where the interface is not yet fully deployed (such as the United States), you can still access the platform securely by routing your connection through a supported region.

This is done simply and legally using a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**. This tool allows you to browse as if you were in a country with full access enabled (like Canada, Japan, or Europe).

We recommend two reliable options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Proton VPN (Free)" icon="shield-check" href="https://protonvpn.com/">
    **Best Free Option.**
    - Unlimited data.
    - Open source and Swiss-based privacy.
    - *Note:* Fewer servers available on the free tier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="NordVPN (Paid)" icon="bolt" href="https://nordvpn.com/">
    **Best Premium Option.**
    - Fastest speeds (essential for real-time trading).
    - Huge variety of countries.
    - Advanced security features.

## Step-by-Step Setup

Select your device to see how to configure your access.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Desktop (PC/Mac)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Download and Install">
        Go to the official website of your chosen provider (Proton or NordVPN) and download the client for Windows or macOS. Install the application.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect to a Supported Region">
        Open the application.
        
        <Warning>
          **Crucial Step:** Select a location where Polymarket is fully active, such as **Canada**, **United Kingdom**, or **Japan**.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Access Polymarket">
        With the secure connection active (Green status), open your browser and refresh the Polymarket page. The interface should load without restrictions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mobile (iOS/Android)">
    The process is similar for mobile devices. Since there is no native app store app for Polymarket yet, you will use the secure connection to access via your mobile browser.

    ### 1. Install the App
    
    * **iOS (iPhone):** Search for "Proton VPN" or "NordVPN" in the **App Store**.
    * **Android:** Search for the app in the **Google Play Store**.

    ### 2. Connect
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the App">
        Launch the app on your phone and log in.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Location">
        Tap on the map or server list.
        **Recommendation:** Connect to **Canada** or **Mexico** for better latency if you are in the Americas.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Grant Permissions">
        Your phone will ask permission to add "VPN Configurations". Click **Allow**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Browse">
        Once the "VPN" icon appears in your status bar, open your mobile browser (Safari/Chrome) and go to Polymarket.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="It's still restricted even with connection active">
    1. **Clear Cache:** Your browser might remember your previous location. Clear your cache/cookies or try opening an **Incognito/Private** window.
    2. **Change Server:** Disconnect and try a different country (e.g., if Canada fails, try Germany).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internet is slow">
    Free services can get congested. If speed is critical for your trading, consider upgrading to a paid plan or switching server locations.
