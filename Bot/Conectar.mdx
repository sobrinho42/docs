PolyTracker Bot is an exclusive tool for subscribers. To ensure security and data integrity, access is not granted automatically: you must **validate your identity** by linking your website account to Telegram.

It is a one-time, quick process. Follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve your Access Code">
    Go to your **Dashboard** on the PolyTracker website.
    
    On the main panel, you will find a highlighted card containing your **Validation Code** (a unique sequence of letters and numbers). Copy this code.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate the Bot">
    Open **PolyTracker Bot** on Telegram and click **Start** (or type `/start`).
    
    The bot will request validation. Simply paste and send the code you copied in the previous step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initial Setup">
    After validation, the bot will ask two quick questions to customize your experience:
    
    1. **Language:** Select between Portuguese 🇧🇷 or English 🇺🇸.
    2. **Timezone:** Set your local time. This is crucial so that "Trade Time" alerts match your clock perfectly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## All Set!
