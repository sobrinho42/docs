Received an alert? Great. Now it's time to evaluate and execute.

<Warning>
  **Attention:** PolyTracker is a **monitoring** tool. Order execution on Polymarket is done manually by you. This ensures you have final control over your money.

## Execution Walkthrough

Follow this flow to replicate the trade safely, whether it's a fresh bet or a position increase.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the Signal on Telegram">
    Upon receiving the notification, first identify the type of move. The bot might signal a **New Position** or a **Buy** (position increase).
    
    Analyze the key information in the image/message:
    1. **The Market:** What is the question? (e.g., "Bitcoin hit $100k?")
    2. **The Side:** Is the whale buying **YES** or **NO**?
    3. **Avg Price:** What price are they paying right now?
    4. **Percentage (%):** How much of their portfolio was used in this entry? (This indicates their **conviction** level).

    <Note>
      **Tip:** A `Buy` signal (Re-entry/Increase) may indicate the investor remains confident in the thesis. Similarly, a high portfolio % suggests a "strong bet," while a low % might just be a test.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Market Link">
    Click the **Market Link** provided in the alert. This opens the exact event page on Polymarket, ensuring you don't enter a wrong or duplicate market.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare the Price (Spread)">
    Before confirming, look at the current *share price*:
    
    * **Ideal Scenario:** The price is close to or below what the whale paid.
    * **Caution Scenario:** The price spiked right after the alert. Evaluate if the risk/reward is still worth it or if it pays to wait for a slight pullback.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Order">
    On the Polymarket interface (right panel):
    
    1.  Ensure the **Buy** tab is selected.
    2.  Choose the correct outcome (**YES** or **NO**) matching the alert.
    3.  Enter your entry amount.
    
    <Warning>
      **Don't copy the dollar amount, copy the logic!**
      
      If the whale entered with $5,000, that might be just 1% of their bankroll. Respect **your own** financial reality. Take into account the percentage of portfolio we discuss in the **Strategies and Risk Management** chapter.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the Transaction">
    Click **Buy** and confirm your operation. Done, you are now positioned alongside the Smart Wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring

The game doesn't end at the buy. Use **PolyTracker Bot** to track this wallet's next steps. If they sell (`Sell` or `Close Position`), you will receive a new alert and can decide whether to take profit as well.
