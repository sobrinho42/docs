<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the Address">
    On the investor's profile within Polymarket, locate and copy the wallet address (usually starting with `0x...`).

    Click the **Track New Wallet** button and, when prompted, paste and send the address you just copied.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a Label (Nickname)">
    Give this wallet a name to identify it (e.g., "Trump Whale", "Sports Sniper"). This name will appear in all future notifications.
