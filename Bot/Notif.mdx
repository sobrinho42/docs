PolyTracker features a detailed notification system. The goal isn't just to inform you *what* happened, but to provide context regarding the *conviction* and the outcome of that trade.

There are **6 types of alerts**. Below, we explain the structure of each one so you can read the market in seconds.

---

## 1. New Position

This alert triggers when the investor enters a market where they previously had no open position. It is the start of a trade.

## 2. Position Updated: BUY (Increasing Position)

Occurs when the investor was already positioned and decides to **buy more**. This usually signals increased confidence in the thesis or a move to average down their entry price (DCA).
