Having access to the best wallets in the world is only 50% of the journey. The other 50% depends on how you manage **your** money while following them.

In this module, we will cover **Proportional Replication**, **Reading Conviction**, and how to filter out noise by focusing on quality.

## 1. Proportional Replication: The Golden Rule

The #1 mistake beginners make when **replicating trades** is trying to copy the **Financial Value** (USD) instead of copying the **Intent** (%).

If a whale has a $1,000,000 balance and bets $10,000, they are risking only **1%** of their capital. If you have a $1,000 portfolio and try to copy the same $10,000 (if you had it) or even $500, you would be risking **50%** of your capital.

<Warning>
  **Never look at the absolute value ($). Look at the proportion.**
  
  Your entry must be based on the size of **your** portfolio.
  
  * **Whale:** Entered with 5% of their portfolio (High conviction).
  * **You:** Should enter with 2% to 5% of **your** portfolio (your management should be more conservative).
</Warning>

### Defining your Unit (Stake)
To simplify, we suggest working with fixed units or limited variable stakes:

| Profile | Suggested Entry per Trade |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | 1% of your total capital |
| **Moderate** | 2% to 3% of your total capital |
| **Aggressive** | Maximum of 5% (Not recommended for beginners) |

## 2. Evaluating Investor Conviction

Before trading, do a quick reading of the "Decision Flow". PolyTracker gives you the data; you interpret the sentiment. How do you know if the whale is confident or just "playing around"?

  <Card title="Portfolio Percentage" icon="chart-pie">
    If the whale allocated a high % of their net worth to this trade, conviction is high. If it's a tiny amount (0.1%), it might just be a test or a *hedge*.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Re-buy (Buy)" icon="layer-group">
    If the whale already had a position and bought more (`Buy`) even as the price moved up or down, this shows they hold a strong thesis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hold Time" icon="clock">
    Wallets that hold positions for longer periods generally have fundamental theses. Wallets that buy and sell in minutes are speculative (riskier).

  <Card title="Frequency" icon="bolt">
    Beware of wallets entering 50 markets a day. They dilute their accuracy. Prefer those who "shoot less, but shoot straight."

## 3. Quality > Quantity

In the initial excitement, it is common to want to follow 10, 20, or 30 different wallets. **This is a trap.**

When trying to monitor too many investors:
1.  Your capital gets pulverized into many tiny trades.
2.  You lose emotional control.
3.  Losses from bad wallets cancel out gains from good ones.

<Tip>
  **The "Dream Team" Strategy:**
  
  Choose **3 to 5 consistent investors** to monitor closely. It is better to miss an opportunity from an unknown wallet than to lose money following the crowd.
</Tip>

## 4. The Circle of Competence

Just because a Smart Wallet entered a market doesn't mean you should follow blindly, especially if it's a topic you know nothing about.

* **Example:** The whale bets heavily on *Indian Cricket*. Do you know the rules? Do you know if it rained at the stadium? Is the star player injured?
* **Action:** If you don't understand the market, the whale's bet is just a data point, not a guarantee.

**Prioritize markets where you have familiarity (Politics, Crypto, Tech, Sports, etc.).** This allows you to validate the whale's thesis with your own knowledge, creating a double layer of safety.

## 5. Smart Diversification

Even following the best, a black swan (unpredictable event) can happen.

* Do not put all your capital into a single event (e.g., US Elections).
* Do not put all your capital into replicating just a single whale.
* Try to keep positions in different categories (e.g., one part in Politics, another in Economy/Crypto).

**Manager's Summary:**
1.  Respect the size of **your** pocket (Proportionality).
2.  Evaluate the whale's conviction (% of portfolio).
3.  Follow few and good (Consistency).
4.  Trade what you understand (Competence).
