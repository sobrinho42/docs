title: 'How to use Radar'
description: 'Turn analysis into strategy: filtering what matters to you.'

The core idea of Radar isn't to "copy everything in sight". It serves as a curation tool for you to evaluate if that wallet makes sense for **YOUR** profile.

Before following anyone, analyze the 4 pillars of compatibility:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Market Type" icon="layer-group">
    Does it trade politics, sports, or macro? Do you understand and feel comfortable in this niche?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Volatility" icon="chart-line-up-down">
    Do positions swing wildly? Does the entry size (ticket) scare you or is it manageable?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time Horizon" icon="hourglass-half">
    Is it a short-term trader (scalper) or long-term holder?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Risk Appetite" icon="shield-halved">
    Is the wallet's aggression level compatible with your own bankroll management?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
