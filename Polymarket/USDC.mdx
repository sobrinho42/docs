## The Fuel: USDC on Polygon

Before starting, it's crucial to understand what you are using. Many beginners confuse crypto with volatility, but this is different.

<Card title="What is USDC? (USD Coin)" icon="circle-dollar-to-slot" iconType="duotone" color="#2775CA">
  Think of USDC simply as **Digital Dollars**.

  * **Total Stability:** Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDC is a "Stablecoin".
  * **The Rule is Clear:** **1 USDC is always worth $1.00 (One US Dollar).**
  * **Utility:** It works like digital chips backed by real assets. You use it to enter markets, and when you withdraw, it is still worth dollars.
</Card>

<Warning>
  **Network Warning:** Polymarket operates exclusively on the **Polygon** network.  
  Do not send via the main Ethereum (ERC20) network, as it is slower and more expensive. On Polygon, fees cost pennies.
</Warning>

  <img src="/images/deposit-methods-overview.png" alt="Deposit methods on Polymarket" />
</Frame>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Via Card (MoonPay)">
    **Recommended for beginners.** The fastest way to turn your local currency into Digital Dollars directly on the platform.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select the card option">
        On the Polymarket deposit screen, choose the buy with card option (usually via partner **MoonPay**).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Fill in details">
        You will be redirected to the secure MoonPay interface. Enter how much you want to deposit and your credit/debit card details.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Finalize purchase">
        Follow the verification instructions and confirm payment. The credit will land directly in your Polymarket account as USDC.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Via Exchange">
    For those already using Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc. **Lower fees for larger amounts.**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Get the deposit address">
        On Polymarket, click **Deposit** and copy the deposit address shown (starts with `0x...`).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Initiate withdrawal at exchange">
        Open your exchange, ensure you have USDC balance, and go to the **Withdraw** option.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select the correct network (CRITICAL)">
        Paste the Polymarket address. In the "Network" field, select **Polygon (MATIC)**.

        <Warning>
          **Caution:** If you select another network (like Ethereum or Solana), your funds may be lost.  
          Confirm it says **Polygon** before sending.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Confirm sending">
        Review the data and confirm. In a few minutes, the balance will appear on Polymarket.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Via Wallet (MetaMask)">
    For those who already have *self-custody* and funds on the Polygon network.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Prepare the wallet">
        Open your MetaMask (or compatible wallet). Ensure you are on the **Polygon Mainnet** and have a USDC balance and a small amount of POL (Matic) for gas fees (although Polymarket subsidizes many transactions, it's good to have).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Send to Polymarket">
        Copy your deposit address on Polymarket and, in your wallet, click **Send**.  
        Paste the address, define the USDC amount, and proceed.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Confirm transaction">
        Check the address digits and sign the transaction.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verifying the balance

After sending, the Polygon network processing time is usually fast (1 to 5 minutes).

1. Go back to your Polymarket account.  
2. Access the **Balance** area at the top.  
3. As soon as the value appears, you are ready to trade.

## Avoiding issues

<Tip>
  **Golden Rule:** If it's your first deposit via exchange or wallet, do a **test send** with a small amount (e.g., $5). Only send the full amount after confirming the test arrived correctly.
</Tip>

* **Balance didn't arrive?** Check the status at the source (Exchange / MoonPay / Wallet).
* **Wrong network?** If you mistakenly sent via another network (like Ethereum), funds won't appear automatically. Contact support or use a Bridge, but this requires advanced technical knowledge.
