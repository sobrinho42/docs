## Execution Walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a market in the Markets tab">
    While logged in, access the **Markets** tab.
    You will see various events organized by category (Politics, Crypto, Sports, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Market Example">
    For this example, let's work with the market:

    **“2026 FIFA World Cup Winner”**

    On the screen, you will see:

    - A **chart** showing the evolution of odds (probability) over time.
    - The list of selections with their respective prices (Brazil, Spain, England, Argentina, etc.).

    <Frame caption="2026 FIFA World Cup Winner market with selections and prices.">
      <img src="/images/market-worldcup-2026.png" alt="2026 FIFA World Cup Winner Market" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your selection (e.g., Spain)">
    Each selection works like a separate “YES” for the question:
    **“Will this team be the 2026 World Cup champion?”**

    Price examples:

    - **Spain — $0.16** → market assigning ~16% chance.
    - **England — $0.13** → market assigning ~13% chance.

    For our example, we will pick **Spain at $0.16**.
    Click on **Spain** to open the order panel (Order Slip).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define how much to invest">
    In the order slip, type the amount you want to invest in **USDC**.
    Let's use the example of **$10.00 on Spain at $0.16**.

    Polymarket automatically calculates:

    - **Shares:** 62.5 (with $10 at $0.16).
    - **Payout (Total Return):** 62.5 shares × $1.00 = **$62.50**.
    - **Potential Profit:** $62.50 - $10.00 = **$52.50**.

    <Frame caption="Order slip with $10 on Spain at $0.16.">
      <img src="/images/order-slip-worldcup-spain.png" alt="Order slip for Spain" />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      **Start small:** For your first trade, use a low amount. The goal here is to learn the mechanics of clicking and confirming, not to get rich on the first try.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the purchase">
    Before clicking **Buy**, double-check:

    - Correct selection (**Spain**).
    - Amount invested (**$10**).
    - Potential return.

    Click **Buy** and wait for confirmation. Once processed, your position will be active in the **Portfolio** menu.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring and Exiting the Position

After buying, you don't need to stay on the market screen.
Go to the **Portfolio** tab to track:

* The position in **Spain — 2026 FIFA World Cup Winner**
* Your average entry price
* The current price of the selection and your PnL (Profit/Loss)

You have two strategic options:

1.  **Hold until the end:**
    If **Spain** wins, each share becomes **$1.00**.
2.  **Sell early (Trade):**
    If Spain's odds improve (e.g., rises to **$0.30** after winning a match), you can sell your shares now and lock in the profit, without waiting for the World Cup final.
