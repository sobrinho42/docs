By now, you already know how to:

1. Create an account
2. Deposit USDC
3. Read the odds (price = probability)

Now you need to understand **what drives these prices**: the **Order Book**.

---

## 1. What is the Order Book?

The **Order Book** is a table that displays, in real-time:

* Who wants to **buy** (bids) → price and size
* Who wants to **sell** (asks) → price and size

It answers questions like:

* What is the best price someone is paying right now?
* What is the best price someone is selling for right now?
* How much money exists at each price level?

> In short: the Order Book is the **map of supply and demand** for that specific market.

## 2. Market Order vs. Limit Order

When you click **Buy** or **Sell**, you are choosing between two execution modes. Understanding the difference saves you money.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Market Order" icon="bolt" color="#22c55e">
    - Executes **immediately**.
    - You accept the price the market is asking right now.
    - **Advantage:** Speed (guaranteed execution).
    - **Risk:** You might pay slightly more if the price jumps.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Limit Order" icon="flag" color="#3b82f6">
    - Executes only at **your price** (or better).
    - You define: "I will only pay $0.50". If the price is $0.51, the order does not execute.
    - **Advantage:** Total price control.
    - **Risk:** Being left out if the market doesn't come back to your price.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Summary:**
  **Market Order** = "I want in now, I don't care about the exact cent."
  **Limit Order** = "I want in at this exact price, I can wait."
</Note>

## 3. Depth and Slippage

Beyond the best price, the Order Book shows **how much** money exists at each level.

* If your order is **small** (e.g., $10), it usually fills entirely at the best price.
* If your order is **large** (e.g., $5,000), it might "eat through" the first price level and start buying from more expensive levels.

This is called **Slippage**:
You see the price at $0.50, but because you bought such a large quantity, your final average entry price ended up at $0.53.

<Warning>
  **Watch out for large orders:**
  Before trading high values, always check the **available quantity** in the first few levels of the book so you don't move the price against yourself.
</Warning>

## 4. Order Book Checklist

Before clicking the button, do this quick check:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Spread ( The Gap)" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Check the difference between the best buyer and the best seller. If the gap is wide (e.g., $0.40 vs $0.60), avoid Market Orders.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Liquidity" icon="layer-group">
    Is there enough quantity at the current price to cover your trade size?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Order Type" icon="hand-pointer">
    For large amounts, prefer **Limit Order**. For small amounts or urgency, use **Market Order**.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
