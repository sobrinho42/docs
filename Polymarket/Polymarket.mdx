**Polymarket** is the world's largest *prediction market*—a platform where you buy and sell shares that represent the outcome of real-world events.

Instead of relying on guesses, random news cycles, or odds set by a bookmaker, Polymarket turns information into price: **share values reflect in real-time what the entire market believes will happen.**

## Sportsbooks vs. Prediction Markets

The main difference lies in **who is on the other side** of your trade.

  <Card title="Traditional Sportsbook" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    - **You bet against the house.**
    - The company sets the odds with a built-in profit margin (vig).
    - If you win too much, they can limit or ban your account.
    - Lack of data transparency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Polymarket" icon="chart-network" color="#3b82f6">
    - **You trade against other users.**
    - Prices are born from real supply and demand (P2P).
    - **No limits:** The platform doesn't profit from your loss.
    - Everything is transparently recorded.
  </Card>

> It is financial market logic applied to events: instead of a bookie setting lines, the collective set of traders (the market) defines the fair price.

## Freedom (Liquidity)

In traditional betting, you are usually "locked in" until the final whistle. On Polymarket, you have the liquidity to enter and exit at any time.

## Transparency and On-Chain Data

One of Polymarket's pillars is that all operations are recorded on the Blockchain (Polygon). Anyone can audit wallets, histories, and volumes.

## How it works in practice

To understand price dynamics, let's analyze a real market example.

### Example: "Will Trump win the election?"

In this market, there are **YES** and **NO** shares. Imagine that `YES` shares are trading at **$0.62**.

<Info>
  **The Math:** A price of $0.62 indicates the market assigns a **62% probability** of victory.
</Info>

1.  If you believe the real chance is higher than 62%, you buy `YES`.
2.  **If the event happens (Trump wins):** Each share becomes worth **$1.00**.
3.  **If the event does not happen:** The share becomes worth **$0.00**.

### The Trading (Don't wait for the end)

Suppose that the day after your purchase, a favorable poll comes out and the price of `YES` rises to **$0.78**.

You are **not** obligated to wait for the election. You can sell your shares at $0.78 right now, realizing profit based solely on the volatility of the news.

## How prices are formed

Shares always fluctuate between **$0.00 and $1.00**. This value is the direct translation of probability:

* **$0.18** = 18% chance
* **$0.51** = 51% chance
* **$0.92** = 92% chance

<Warning>
  Polymarket **does not define** these prices. They are the result of what buyers and sellers (like you and the Whales) are negotiating at that moment.
</Warning>

It is an environment of clear incentives: **those with the best information profit.**
