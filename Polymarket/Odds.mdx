On Polymarket, you don't place "bets" on a slip. You buy **Digital Assets** (Shares) that represent a future outcome.

To trade profitably, you need to master three concepts: the **$1.00 Rule**, the **Resolution Date**, and **Implied Probability**.

## 1. The Golden Rule ($1.00)

Every market on Polymarket is binary. Either the event happens (**YES**), or it doesn't (**NO**).

Regardless of the price you pay today, the final value of that share in the future will always be one of these two:

  <Card title="Win (Event occurred)" icon="check" color="#22c55e">
    Each share you own will redeem for exactly **$1.00**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Loss (Event didn't occur)" icon="xmark" color="#ef4444">
    Each share you own will redeem for **$0.00**.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

> **Your profit is the difference.**
> If you bought a "YES" share at **$0.40** and the event happened, you receive **$1.00**. Your net profit was **$0.60** per share (150% return).

## 2. Price = Probability

This is the key to reading the market. The share price tells you exactly what chance the market is assigning to that event.

* Price **$0.10** = **10%** chance.
* Price **$0.50** = **50%** chance.
* Price **$0.85** = **85%** chance.

### How to find opportunities (Value Betting)?
You should buy when **your analysis** disagrees with the market price.

* **Scenario:** The market says Bitcoin has a **30%** chance of hitting $100k (Price: $0.30).
* **Your Analysis:** You believe the real chance is **60%**.
* **Action:** You buy "cheap" ($0.30) something you believe is worth much more. If the market agrees with you later, the price will rise.

## 3. Resolution Date

Every market has an expiration date. It is crucial to check the **resolution date** before entering.

<Warning>
  **Why does this matter?**
  If you buy a share for an event that only resolves in **December 2026**, your capital could be "locked" there until that date, unless you sell to someone else earlier.
</Warning>

* **Short Term Markets:** "Will ETH price go up today?" (High volatility, quick resolution).
* **Long Term Markets:** "Who will be President in 2028?" (Capital locked for years, potentially lower immediate liquidity).

Always check the market **Rules** by clicking on the description tab to understand exactly *how* the winner will be decided.

## 4. Two ways to Profit

You don't need to marry your position. There are two paths to putting money in your pocket:

### A. Hold until Resolution (The Investor)
You buy the share, wait for the event date to arrive, and if you are right, redeem your shares for **$1.00** each.
* *Risk:* You need to predict the final result correctly.
* *Reward:* Maximum return ($1.00).

### B. Trading / Early Exit (The Speculator)
You buy the share cheap, wait for favorable news to drive the price up, and sell to someone else **before the event ends**.

<Tip>
  **Trading Example:**
  1. You buy "Brazil wins the match" at **$0.40** before kickoff.
  2. Brazil scores a goal in the first half. The probability of victory rises.
  3. The share price jumps to **$0.75**.
  4. You **sell** at $0.75 and lock in the profit, without risking Brazil losing the lead in the second half.
</Tip>

## Summary

1.  **Buy:** You acquire shares (e.g., YES or NO).
2.  **Cost:** The price ranges from $0.01 to $0.99.
3.  **Value:** The current price reflects the probability (%) of happening.
4.  **Exit:** You can sell at any time (Trading) or wait for it to become $1.00 (Hold).
