        - Go to **Deposit**.
        - Select **USDC**.
        - Choose your **preferred network** (e.g., Polygon).
          - *Note:* We **recommend Polygon** due to low fees and high compatibility.
        - Copy the **deposit address** displayed.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="To Wallet">
        - Open your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Phantom).
        - Choose the **network** where you want to receive the USDC (e.g., Polygon).
        - Confirm the wallet supports **USDC on that network**.
        - Copy your **public address** (usually starting with `0x...` on EVM networks).
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the withdrawal on Polymarket">
    On the Polymarket **Withdraw** screen:

    1. Paste the **destination address** in the **Address** field.
    2. Enter the **Amount** in USDC (or use **Max** to withdraw everything).
    3. Verify that the **network indicated** on Polymarket matches the network you chose at the destination.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and confirm">
    <Warning>
      **Quick Checklist:**
      - Does the address match (check first and last characters)?
      - Does the exchange/wallet accept **USDC on the chosen network**?
      - For your first large withdrawal, consider testing with a small amount (e.g., $5).
    </Warning>

    If everything looks correct, click **Withdraw** to confirm.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track funds arrival">
    - Networks like **Polygon** usually credit funds within minutes.
    - Check the balance on your **exchange** or **wallet** in the deposit history area.
    - If in doubt, check the history on Polymarket, copy the **TXID**, and verify it on the network explorer (e.g., Polygonscan).
  </Step>
