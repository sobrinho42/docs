        **Recommended for beginners**
        - Direct login via Google or a magic link sent to your email.
        - The platform creates and manages your wallet for you.
        - Simple and fast recovery.
      </Card>

      <Card title="Crypto Wallet" icon="wallet" color="#F59E0B">
        **For advanced users**
        - Connect MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect.
        - Signature-based authentication (no password).
        - Full control of private keys (*self-custody*).
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Note>
      Crypto wallets are powerful but intended for users who already understand **custody**, **signatures**, and **key management**.
      If you are a beginner, stick with **Google or Email**.

    Depending on your previous choice:

    **Option A — Google / Email**
    1. Click **“Continue with Google”** or enter your email address.
    2. If using email, click the magic link sent to your inbox.
    3. If using Google, simply authorize the login pop-up.

    **Option B — Crypto Wallet**
    1. Click on your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
    2. A pop-up will appear requesting a **signature**.
    3. Sign the request.
       > This is not a transaction and costs nothing (gas-free).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm access is working">
    After logging in, you will be redirected to the main dashboard.

    Check if:
    - There is a profile icon in the top right corner.
    - The balance appears (e.g., **$0.00 USDC**).
    - A wallet address starting with `0x...` is available.
